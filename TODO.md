- bug: certain valid scenarios still cause infinite loops.
  - e.g.: operand1 constrained to 8. operand2 10 to 20. result constrained to 15.
  - probably need some sort of sensing in the problems view loop? or maybe put that into a new method willConverge of validation.
- ControlPanel(?): add .was-validated only after submit.
- validation.extremeResult: change operations assignment to use formdata.
- ControlPanel.submitToState: finish all state submissions.
- ControlPanel: add reset button to form.
- eject Redux
- add CSS media query for printing.
