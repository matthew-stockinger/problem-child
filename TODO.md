- Operations: add event handlers
  - mouse pointer is a cursor when hovering over operations icons. Fix this.
  - on form submit
    - read which ones are green and submit to state on submit button click.
    - challenge: ControlPanel.submitToState takes formdata as input. How do I append to that specific formdata from the Operations Component? **the FormData should store the state of this component.**
- ControlPanel(?): add .was-validated only after submit.
- validation.extremeResult: change operations assignment to use formdata.
- ControlPanel.submitToState: finish all state submissions.
- ControlPanel: add reset button to form.
